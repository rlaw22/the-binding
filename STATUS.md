## Architecture: How Actions Work (Option B)

**Before:** `generateSceneActions()` overwrote the AI DM's suggested actions with only manifest content items. If the AI narrated "the innkeeper offers garlic oil," the player had no button for "Take the vial."

**After:** The AI DM's suggestions are preserved, deduplicated against manifest content items, and merged into the action list. Players now see:
1. **Exploration actions** — manifest content items (what the scene author defined)
2. **Contextual actions** — AI DM's creative suggestions (what the narrative created)
3. **Exit action** — always last (or first under strong/forced pressure)

**Dedup logic:** Word-level overlap — if >50% of an AI suggestion's significant words match an existing content item, it's filtered as a duplicate.

**Files changed:** `src/ai-dm/dm-service.js` (30 lines added, 5 removed)

## Beta Launch Checklist

- [x] LLM_API_KEY set on Render
- [x] LLM_BASE_URL set on Render
- [x] LLM_MODEL set on Render
- [x] ADMIN_KEY set on Render
- [x] Health check confirms `betaEnabled: true`
- [x] 20 beta tokens generated (beta-wave-1)
- [ ] Distribute tokens to testers
- [ ] Monitor feedback via `/api/admin/feedback`

---

## Known Issues

### Gameplay
- [ ] Frankenstein and Holmes manifests not yet audited for exit label / NPC bugs
- [ ] Scene_12 `ask_about_lucy_renfield` — Renfield dialogue could be richer
- [ ] Some LOW-severity exit labels still narrow (BUG-31 through BUG-39, Acts 1-3)

### Architecture
- [ ] No unit tests for `generateSceneActions` merge logic specifically
- [ ] AI contextual actions are not persisted across sessions (regenerated each turn)
- [ ] No max cap on contextual actions (AI could suggest many)
- [ ] Feedback stored in-memory only (last 500 entries, lost on restart)

---

## Next Steps
- [ ] Playtest full Dracula adventure end-to-end with real LLM
- [ ] Monitor first wave of beta tester feedback
- [ ] Audit Frankenstein and Holmes manifests for the same bug patterns
- [ ] Add unit tests for the Option B merge logic
- [ ] Consider adding "garlic oil" as a tracked inventory item
- [ ] Consider persisting feedback to disk for durability
- [ ] Rotate ADMIN_KEY after initial testing confirms everything works
